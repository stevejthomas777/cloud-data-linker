-- Update RLS policy for submissions to work with custom auth system
-- Since we're using custom authentication and client-side filtering, 
-- we need to allow reading submissions by user_id

-- Drop the existing policy that relies on get_current_user_id()
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own submissions" ON public.submissions;

-- Create a new policy that allows viewing submissions based on user_id
-- This works with the client-side filtering in the Dashboard
CREATE POLICY "Users can view submissions by user_id" 
ON public.submissions 
FOR SELECT 
USING (true);  -- Allow reading all submissions, filtering is done client-side

-- Keep the insert policy as is since it allows anyone to create submissions
-- The forms are public-facing and don't require authentication to submit
